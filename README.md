# DMDD_Airline_Reservation_System

Our project is to develop a database dedicated to the Flight Reservation System component of an Airline company, say for example American Airlines.
The business requirement is restricted to the flights exclusive to the Airline company. 
Note that this is different than general ticketing systems like Kayak or Expedia which allows users to book flight tickets from multiple Airlines. 
This document outlines the problem statement and the objectives of the team.
We also provide the Entity Relationship diagram of our proposed database structure and a detailed listing of our entities....
